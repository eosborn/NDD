## project for the Translational Health Data Science Fellowship

Aim 1: collect list of genes associated with neurodevelopemntal disorders (ASD, speech delay, nonverbal)

Aim 2: scrape KEGG mapper output for pathways/modules and create dictionaires to organize groupings

Aim 3: apply gene list and groupings to existing sequencing data for patient cohort, identify relevant genes/groupings for clinical interpretation
